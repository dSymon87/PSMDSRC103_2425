    " - because we can used it again and again. rather than copying and re-running code again.\n",

    " - the disadvantage is when there is alot of function. it will be very difficult to understand and debug\n",
    " - sequential code is simple to do, unlike functions needs  some tinkering. usefull when your task is simple and no need to write the function. but the disadvantage of this is when there is repetition use of the code. you paste it over and over again\n",
